# 📋 CPT + Payer Rules Validator

A web-based tool to validate **CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)** codes and display **payer-specific rules** to assist healthcare staff with prior authorization, eligibility checks, and documentation accuracy.

---

## 🎯 What is this project?

This project helps users:
- Validate if a CPT code exists and is properly formatted (5-digit numeric).
- Enter **multiple CPT codes** at once and get results for each.
- Select a **payer** (like Medicare, Blue Cross, United) to see any payer-specific rules tied to the CPT code(s).
- See suggestions/autocomplete when typing a CPT code.
- Track validation history in the browser session.
- Learn from a clear, modern, and professional user interface.

It demonstrates my skills in:
✅ Front-end web development  
✅ Clean UI/UX design  
✅ Data validation and error handling  
✅ Working with JSON datasets  
✅ Organizing and documenting a realistic healthcare-related application
